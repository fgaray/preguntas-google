    Take their interview prep quiz.
    You will have 3-4 practical interviews where yoy will ve given a problem and told to write code to solve it.
    They want ti know how you would approach the problen and whag are yoyr concerns (i.e you write a brute force solution then mention how its inefficient)

    Heh, just go for it, really. I was amazed to be contacted in the first place and just decided to try it, not really believing I'd actually have any chances. I did get lucky though because I had an interview with Nintendo the day before, which I completely screwed up. But the experience was invaluable for the Google interviews.

    My best advice is to know what the question is. Don't just barge into a solution.

    For example, if you're asked to count the number of different words in a file, poor candidates will read the file, split on spaces, and increment a hash table.

    Good candidates will, before assuming anything, ask if:
    >It's a plain text file 
    >It's ASCII
    >If it fits in memory 
    >If it's doable on a single machine 
    >If it's a space separated language 
    >If it'll overflow a 32bit int 
    >If it would be case sensitive 
    >How to handle conjugations like cuck and cucked
    >How to handle homographs like wind (noun) out wind (verb)

    Obviously you don't expect as much from fresh grads as veterans, but there's no point in being mediocre

    Nearly 30. Debating whether I'll complete a Masters or move onto a PhD. Right now I'm enrolled at a top public university taking part-time courses in CS and made a 99 in my first programming course there. I am coding all the time and reading, doing problem sets and studying constantly.

    I worked for a large fortune 500 company as an analyst, got laid off (not my fault, company treats workers like cogs) , had lots of money saved up and huge amount of free time so that's why I enrolled in the university.

    I really hated my job as an analyst and always been interested in the theoretical side of computer science (computability theory and computational complexity), but as I started self-studying I found this has expanded to data structures & algorithms. I am very, very interested in applying mathematical principles to programming.

    Starting to get into category theory and curious to see its connections to functional programming.

    Anyway, long story short... I want to work at a place like google because it seems like a mixture between academia and industry. Startups around here are mostly app development, or looking for web devs.

    Just finished my last interview for a tech team in Amazon corporate. Brush up on your theory as well as your practical knowledge. Do your research. Ensure the examples you are giving in regards to your work history are in line with the company's ideals.

    Your desire for the will get you 80 percent of the way. Your experience and intuition will dictate the final 20 percent.

    Best of luck. Much love.

    As for prepping for interviews. I went to various online programming problem sites: Hacker Rack, SPOJ, UVA, Euler, etc. and started doing as many problems as I could to practice-- pick the popular ones. If I couldn't figure out a problem I would study other people's solutions until I got the general idea. Over time, I got better and better and started to see patterns in tackling problems. Working through Cracking the Coding Interview type books, and really studying the solutions, helps as a start but you'll need to work at a harder level then the problems in those books. Brush up on basic data structures and algorithms or other topics if you're interviewing for a specific position. I interviewed in the middle of a Computer Engineering degree and I spent around 1 month of intense preparation (thats all I did after school).

    They sell books about passing these horseshit interviews. All you need to do is drill yourself in CLRS or Skeina's Algorithm Design manual and you're in https://www.glassdoor.ca/Interview/Google-Software-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE9079.0,6_KO7,24.htm

    You first have to pass the pajeet phone screening where you have to program over the phone while some pajeet picks up his laundry and shit in the background. 'Ok, implement this and read me line by line the program'.

    Then you go do those silly whiteboard interviews. Each one is like 45min long with different engineers. Everytime it's "Solve this ridiculous corner case problem" and then you have to optimize your solution to make it better/faster so obviously concentrating on optimization would be something you would want to do.

    Then they don't hire you anyway because in actuality Silicon Valley is a big scam. There's always 200+ jobs open at Google so they can tell the Fed government they can't find anybody good to work there so please let us import pajeets and get H1B visas. If you do get a job it will be a shit starting wage and they will try to push you out with performance reviews to get more cheap students applying and plead for more pajeets from the feds
