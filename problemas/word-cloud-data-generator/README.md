 You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word
 corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

To do this, you'll need data. Write code that takes a long string and builds its
word cloud data in a dictionary â†´ , where the keys are words and the values are
the number of times the words occurred.

Think about capitalized words. For example, look at these sentences: 

```
'After beating the eggs, Dana read the next step:'
'Add milk and eggs, then add flour and sugar.'
```

What do we want to do with "After", "Dana", and "add"? In this example, your
final dictionary should include one "Add" or "add" with a value of 222. Make
reasonable (not necessarily perfect) decisions about cases like "After" and
"Dana".

Assume the input will only contain words and standard punctuation. 

You could make a reasonable argument to use regex in your solution. We won't,
mainly because performance is difficult to measure and can get pretty bad.
