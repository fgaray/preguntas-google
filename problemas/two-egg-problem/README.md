A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be
dropped from without breaking.

If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped from
that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop the egg
again.

Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without
breaking, with as few drops as possible.
