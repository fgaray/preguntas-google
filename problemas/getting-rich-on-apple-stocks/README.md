 Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:

* The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
* The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.

So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the
best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock
yesterday.
