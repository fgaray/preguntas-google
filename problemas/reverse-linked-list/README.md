Hooray! It's opposite day. Linked lists go the opposite way today.

Write a function for reversing a linked list ↴ . Do it in-place ↴ .

Your function will have one input: the head of the list.

Your function should return the new head of the list.

Here's a sample linked list node class: 

```
class LinkedListNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next  = None
```
